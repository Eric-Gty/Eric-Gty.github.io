Welcome to my personal website! I'm 高天予 (Gao Tianyu),  a senior undergraduate student at Sichuan University. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in Computer Vision and Recommendation System. I'm lucky enough to meet my advisor Pro. Yang Jin and learned a lot from him. As an undergraduate student, I think it's better to benefit from interdisciplinary, hence I did research in cyber-security, recommendation system, and computer vision for the past three years.

Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position and hope to join the lab with many amazing advisors and students.
